            <h2>THE SUPER MARIO GAMES</h2>
            <p> Super Mario was created by Nintendo as a game based on and staring the fictional character, Mario. It is
               known as the Super Mario Bros series or simply the Mario series. These are the central series of the
               greater Mario franchise. For every major Nintendo console, at least one Super Mario game has been
               released.<br>
               <br>
               In the series there are twenty-one similar games and one cross-series game which is super Mario world 2:
               Yoshi’s Island Break. The typical Super Mario games are set in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom with Mario
               being the player character. He is often joined by his brother Luigi, and other members of the Mario
               cast. Being a platform game, the player runs and jumps across platforms in themed levels, with simple
               plots, most ending with Mario rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary antagonist Bowser.
               <br>
               Super Mario Bros was the first game in the series and established the series’ core gameplay and
               elements. It was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in 1985.
               <br>
               The Mario series is made up of 2D origins, Super Mario Land games and Super Mario World games including
               3D and open worlds.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>SUPER MARIO LAND GAMES</h2>
            <p> The first Super Mario Land is the first handheld Super Mario game and was released for the Game Boy. It
               is side scrolling platformer in which Mario sets out to save Princess Daisy.
               <br>
               Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins has the introduction of Mario’s rival Wario, who in the first land
               game took over Mario’s castle. In this game Mario must collect six golden coins in order to reclaim his
               castle.
               <br>
               This story was then continued in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3. This became the first spin-off series
               Wario Land.<br>
            </p>
            <br>

               the system. This consists of nine worlds displayed via a world map overworld.
               <br>
               It sold more than twenty million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling SNES game. It also led to
               an animated television series of the same name and a prequel, Yoshi's Island, released in August and
               October 1995. <br>
            </p>

               The first 3D and open world entry was Super Mario 64, this was for the Nintendo 64 in the early 1990s.

               Peaches castle to unlock later courses and areas. With the Nintendo 64’s analogue sticks making it
               possible to move precisely in any direction.

            <h2>History of Super Mario</h2>
            <br>
            <p> Super Mario is a platform game series created by Nintendo based on and starring the fictional plumber
                Mario. Alternatively called the Super Mario Bros. series or simply the Mario series, it is the
                central series of the greater Mario franchise. At least one Super Mario game has been released for every
                major Nintendo video game console. There are twenty-one similar games in the series and one cross-series
                game, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, which may or may not be included as part of the series (see
                Super Mario World games).
                <br>
                The Super Mario games are typically set in the fictional Mushroom Kingdom with Mario as the player
                character. He is often joined by his brother, Luigi, and occasionally by other members of the Mario
                cast. As a platform game, the player runs and jumps across platforms and atop enemies in themed levels.
                The games have simple plots, typically with Mario rescuing the kidnapped Princess Peach from the primary
                antagonist, Bowser. The first game in the series, Super Mario Bros., released for the Nintendo
                Entertainment System (NES) in 1985, established the series' core gameplay concepts and elements. These
                include a multitude of power-ups and items that give Mario special powers such as fireball-throwing and
                size-changing.

            <h2>2D origins (1985–1995)</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Director Takashi Tezuka, producer Shigeru Miyamoto, and composer Koji Kondo, pictured in 2015
                Super Mario Bros. the first side-scrolling 2D platform game to feature Mario, was derived by
                collaboration of Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka as a successor to the 1983 arcade game
                Mario Bros., which starred two characters: Mario, the titular character that first appeared in Donkey
                Kong as the original player character and its sequel where he was a final boss, and Luigi, who first
                appeared in Mario Bros.The etymology of adding "Super" to the title came after deciding to integrate
                the Super Mushroom into the game.Super Mario Bros. was released for the Nintendo Entertainment
                System (NES). It established many core Mario gameplay concepts. The brothers Mario and Luigi must rescue
                Princess Toadstool (later called Princess Peach) from Bowser/King Koopa in the Mushroom Kingdom. The
                game consists of eight worlds of four levels each, totaling 32 levels altogether. Though the worlds
                differ in themes, the fourth level is always a fortress or castle that ends with a fight against Bowser
                (or one of his minions disguised as him).This is one of the best-selling video games of all time.
                <br>
                Super Mario Bros.2 in Japan is the first sequel to the original Super Mario Bros. It uses
                the Super Mario Bros. engine, with additions such as weather, character movements, and more complex
                levels,
                altogether yielding a much higher difficulty. The game follows the same style of level progression
                as Super Mario Bros., with eight initial worlds of four levels each. At that time, this sequel was not
                released outside Japan since Nintendo of America did not want the Mario series to be known to
                players outside of Japan for frustrating difficulty. It remained inaccessible to a steadily broadening
                market of American video game players, becoming stylistically outdated by the time the Japanese Super
                Mario
                Bros.2 could be eventually delivered to America. The game later debuted outside Japan in 1993 as "Super
                Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels" in the compilation game Super Mario All-Stars for the Super Nintendo
                Entertainment System (SNES).
                <br>
                In Super Mario Bros. 2 (Super Mario USA in Japan), Mario and his companions are out to stop the evil
                frog Wart in the Subcon dreamland. Based on a discarded prototype,the game was instead originally
                released as Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic in Japan, and was ultimately converted into a Mario game for
                the rest of the world as Super Mario Bros. 2, before being released in Japan as Super Mario USA as part
                of Super Mario All-Stars. One of the game's most defining aspects is the four player characters: not
                only Mario, but Luigi, Princess Peach and Toad are available for single-player action, each with defined
                character movements: Luigi jumps higher, the Princess glides through the sky for a short amount of
                time,etc. Characters here also can pluck vegetables from the ground to throw at enemies. This is also
                the
                first Super Mario game to use a life meter, which allows Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toad to be hit up
                to four times before dying.
                <br>
                Super Mario Bros. 3 is divided into eight themed worlds, each with 6–10 levels and several bonus
                stages displayed as locations on a mapped overworld. These locations are not necessarily in a linear
                order,
                and the player is occasionally permitted to skip levels or play the game out of order. Completed levels
                cannot be replayed. The penultimate boss stage in each world is a side-scrolling level atop an
                airship ("Doom Ship") with a fight against one of Bowser's seven Koopalings. The game introduced a
                diverse
                array of new power-ups, including flight as Raccoon Mario or the level-long P-Wing allowing permanent
                flight through a whole level. Bowser is again the final boss.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Super Mario Land games</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Super Mario Land is the first handheld Super Mario game apart from the Game & Watch conversion of
                Super Mario Bros., and was released for the Game Boy. As with other games in the series, it is a
                sidescrolling platformer in which Mario sets out to save Princess Daisy. Power-ups include hearts, which
                give Mario an
                extra life (similar to a 1-up mushroom) and the Superball Flower, which allows Mario to shoot
                projectiles. The game consists of twelve levels split across four worlds.
                <br>
                Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins introduces Mario's rival, Wario, who had taken over Mario's
                castle during the events of Super Mario Land and forces Mario to collect the six golden coins in order
                to
                reenter and reclaim his castle. While its predecessor is similar to the original Super Mario Bros.,
                Super Mario Land 2 has more in common with Super Mario World. The player is no longer restricted to
                only moving towards the right. A bell at each level's end activates a minigame, where the player can try
                to get extra lives. There are 32 levels, based on several themed worlds each with its own boss. Three
                power-ups return: the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Super Star. The game introduces the Carrot
                power-up, which gives Mario large rabbit ears that let him glide when falling for a limited time.
                Its story was continued in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, which retroactively became the first of a
                spin-off series, Wario Land.

            <h2>Super Mario World games</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System is the best-selling game of the system
                Super Mario World was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and consists of nine worlds
                displayed via a world map overworld. It is a direct successor to the Super Mario Bros. games, with the
                subtitle Super Mario Bros. 4 in Japan. Unlike Super Mario Bros. 3, however, where each world map is
                separate, the world map here is unique and covers the whole game. Some of the levels have hidden
                alternate exits. Mario's new moves include a spin jump and the rideable Yoshi, who can eat enemies and
                either swallow or spit them out. Power-ups include the new Cape Feather, based on Super Mario Bros. 3's
                Super Leaf, which lets Mario and Luigi fly with a cape.
                <br>
                Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island was released for the SNES in 1995. To reunite baby Mario with his
                brother Luigi, who has been kidnapped by Kamek, the player controls Yoshi as the primary character
                through 48 levels while carrying Baby Mario. Yoshi runs and jumps to reach the end of the level while
                solving puzzles and collecting items. In a style new to the series, the game has a hand-drawn aesthetic.
                The game introduces his signature abilities to flutter jump and produce eggs from swallowed enemies.
                Yoshi's Island received "instant" and "universal acclaim", according to IGN and review aggregator
                Metacritic, and sold over four million copies. Yoshi's signature characteristics established in Yoshi's
                Island would carry throughout a series of cameos, spin-offs, and sequels. Sources have debated on
                whether Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, where the player primarily controls a Yoshi carrying Baby
                Mario, should count as a Super Mario game. Miyamoto responded affirmatively when asked if
                Yoshi's Island is a Super Mario game, with Tezuka later adding:
                <br>
                "When that game debuted, I wanted people to understand that Yoshi was part of the Mario world, and that
                be conveyed whether through title or gameplay. To me, it's part of the Mario series, but today's Yoshi
                games? They've changed from those origins, so I think it's okay to think of Yoshi living in his own
                universe. You can think of it separately from Mario's world."

            <h2>Introduction of 3D and open worlds (1996–2005)</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Super Mario 64 for the Nintendo 64 (pictured) is the first 3D and open world entry
                In the early 1990s, director and producer Shigeru Miyamoto had conceived a 3D Mario design during
                development of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) game Star Fox (1993). He considered using
                the Super FX chip to develop a SNES game, Super Mario FX, with gameplay based on "an entire world in
                miniature, like miniature trains". He eventually reformulated the idea for the Nintendo 64, not for
                its substantially greater power, but because its controller has more buttons for gameplay. Super
                Mario 64 was developed over approximately three years, with one year spent on the design concept and
                approximately two years on production. Production began on September 7, 1994, and concluded on May
                20, 1996. Super Mario 64 is the first 3D and open world game in the series, and a launch game for
                the Nintendo 64 home console. Each level is an enclosed environment where the player is free to explore
                in all directions without time limits. The player collects Power Stars from the paintings in Peach's
                castle to unlock later courses and areas. The Nintendo 64's analog stick makes an extensive
                repertoire of precise movements in all directions possible. The game introduced moves such as punching,
                triple jumping, and using a Wing Cap to fly. It is the first Super Mario series game to feature Charles
                Martinet's voice acting for Mario. Mario must once again save Princess Peach from Bowser. The game's
                power-ups differ from previous games, now being three different hats with temporary powers: the Wing
                Cap, allowing Mario to fly; the Metal Cap, turning him into metal; and the Vanish Cap, allowing him to
                walk through obstacles. A remake of the game called Super Mario 64 DS was released for Nintendo DS in
                2004 and 2005.
                <br>
                Super Mario Sunshine
                Main article: Super Mario Sunshine
                Super Mario Sunshine is the second 3D Super Mario game. It was released in 2002 for the GameCube. In it,
                Mario and Peach travel to Isle Delfino for a vacation when a Mario doppelgänger, going by the name of
                Shadow Mario, appears and vandalizes the entire island. Mario is sentenced to clean the island with a
                water-squirting accessory called F.L.U.D.D. Super Mario Sunshine shares many similar gameplay elements
                with its predecessor Super Mario 64, yet introduces moves, like spinning while jumping, and several
                other actions through the use of F.L.U.D.D. The game contains a number of independent levels, which can
                be reached from the hub, Delfino Plaza. Mario collects Shine Sprites by completing tasks in the levels,
                which in return unlock levels in Delfino Plaza by way of abilities and plot-related events.[18] Sunshine
                introduces the last of Bowser's eight children, Bowser Jr., as an antagonist. Yoshi also appears again
                for Mario to ride in certain sections.

            <h2>2D revival and progression-focused 3D games (2006–2016)</h2>

            <p>
                New Super Mario Bros. series logo
                After no original 2D game releases in the series since 1995, New Super Mario Bros. was released on the
                Nintendo DS in 2006. In it, Mario and Luigi set out to save Princess Peach from Bowser Jr. The gameplay
                is 2D, but most of the characters and objects are 3D on two-dimensional backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D
                effect. The game uses an overworld map similar to those of Super Mario Bros. Deluxe. Some levels have
                multiple exits. The classic power-ups (Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Super Star) return alongside the
                Mega Mushroom, Blue Shell, and Mini Mushroom.
                <br>
                New Super Mario Bros. Wii (2009) features 4-player co-op and new power-ups: the Propeller Mushroom, the
                Ice Flower, and the Penguin Suit. All characters can ride Yoshi.
                <br>
                New Super Mario Bros. 2 was released in July and August 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS. The player, as Mario
                or Luigi, tries to save Princess Peach from Bowser and the Koopalings, with the game's secondary goal to
                collect one million coins. Several gameplay elements were introduced to help achieve this goal, such as
                the Gold Flower, a rarer variant of the Fire Flower that turns items into coins.
                <br>
                New Super Mario Bros. U, the Wii U follow-up to New Super Mario Bros. Wii, was released in November
                2012. It introduces both a Flying Squirrel suit that lets the players glide through the air, and
                asymmetric gameplay that allows the player holding the GamePad to influence the environment. In June
                2013, New Super Luigi U was released as a downloadable content (DLC) package for the game, featuring
                shorter, but more difficult levels, starring Luigi as the main protagonist instead of his brother.
                Subsequently, it was released as a standalone retail game on August 25 in North America. The
                Nintendo Switch port New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe includes both the main game and New Super Luigi U,
                and new playable characters Nabbit and Toadette.

            <h2>Super Mario Galaxy games</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Miyamoto explained that when he was developing Super Mario 64 with Yoshiaki Koizumi, they realized that
                the title would be more directed towards the "core gamer", rather than the casual, "pick-up-and-go"
                gamer. After Super Mario Sunshine, their focus shifted to more accessible, casual games, leading
                them to develop Super Mario Galaxy with more progression-oriented paths. Super Mario Galaxy was launched
                in 2007 for the Wii. It is set in outer space, where Mario travels between "galaxies" to collect Power
                Stars, earned by completing quests or defeating enemies. It introduced motion controls to the series.
                Each galaxy contains a number of planets and other space objects for the player to explore. The game's
                physics system gives each celestial object its own gravitational force, which lets the player
                circumnavigate rounded or irregular planetoids by walking sideways or upside down. The player is usually
                able to jump from one independent object and fall towards another close object. Though the main gameplay
                and physics are in 3D, there are several points in the game where the player's movements are restricted
                into a 2D axis. Several new power-ups appear following the new game mechanics. All of them return in the
                sequel, Super Mario Galaxy 2, besides the Ice Flower and Red Star power-ups.
                <br>
                Super Mario Galaxy 2 was initially developed as an expansion pack to Galaxy, although it eventually
                developed into its own game, released on May 23, 2010. It retains the basic premise of its predecessor
                and includes its items and power-ups. These include the Cloud Flower, which allows Mario to create
                platforms in mid-air and the Rock Mushroom, which turns Mario into a rolling boulder. Mario can also
                ride Yoshi along. It was released to widespread critical acclaim, getting better reviews than its
                predecessor.
            </p>

            <h2>Super Mario 3D Land and 3D World</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Two games in the series have attempted to translate the gameplay of the 2D games into a 3D environment,
                and simplify the control scheme of the 3D games through including more linear levels. Super Mario 3D
                Land was released for the Nintendo 3DS in November and December 2011. It is the first original 3D Super
                Mario game on a handheld console, since all previous handheld games were either 2D or ports of previous
                games. It also brought back several older gameplay features, including the Super Leaf power-up last seen
                in Super Mario Bros. 3.
                
                Super Mario 3D World, the sequel to Super Mario 3D Land, was released for the Wii U on November 22, 2013
                in North America, and utilized the same gameplay mechanics as its predecessor. Co-operative
                multiplayer is available for up to four players. The game introduced the ability to turn the characters
                into cats able to attack and scale walls in order to reach new areas, and to create clones of the
                characters. Like Super Mario Bros. 2, it features Princess Peach and Toad as playable characters in
                addition to Mario and Luigi. Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy is also unlocked later in the game.
                Miyamoto said that "even though that's a 3D game, it's a little more accessible to everybody."

            <h2>Super Mario Maker games</h2>

            <p>
                Super Mario Maker is a creation tool released for the Wii U in September 2015 which allows players
                to create their own levels based on the gameplay and style of Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3,
                Super Mario World, and New Super Mario Bros. U, as well as to share their creations online. Based on
                existing games, several gameplay mechanics were introduced for the game, with existing ones also
                available to be used together in new ways. A Nintendo 3DS version of the game called Super Mario Maker
                for Nintendo 3DS, was released in December 2016. It features a few new pre-installed levels, but no
                online level sharing. Super Mario Maker 2 is a new version of Super Mario Maker with many new items,
                themes, and enemies, a world-builder, as well as online multiplayer. The game was released on June 28,
                2019 for the Nintendo Switch.

            <h2>Super Mario Run</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Super Mario Run is a side-scrolling and auto-scrolling video game released in December 2016 on the iOS
                platform, then in March 2017 on Android. It is the first official Mario game developed for non-Nintendo
                hardware (since previous attempts all faced cancellation), as well as the first official Super Mario
                game developed for mobile devices. As such, it features simplified controls that allow it to be played
                with only one hand. In this game, Mario runs automatically, and the player's in charge of controlling
                the jumping action so that Mario avoids all hazards. This is achieved by touching the tactile screens
                these devices are built with, and the longer the player touches the jump button, the higher Mario jumps.
                This game also includes a "Toad Rally" mode, quite similar to the "VS Boo" mode of Super Mario Bros
                Deluxe, in which players have to complete a level faster than a computer-controlled Toad. Success in
                this mode earns the player access to in-game money to spend in customization options for it to create
                its own "Mushroom Kingdom" map, using mechanics similar to Farmville, into Super Mario Run's third
                gameplay mode.

            <h2>Super Mario Odyssey</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                After having fallen out of favor by the mid-2000s, open-world "collectathon" 3D platformers such as
                Super Mario 64, Banjo-Kazooie and Super Mario Sunshine had become less common.For example, the 3D
                adventure game Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts (2008) explicitly mocked the perceived tedium of collecting
                large quantities of tokens.By the mid-2010s, however, 3D platformers were aiming to replicate such
                experiences, including Yooka-Laylee and A Hat in Time. Super Mario Odyssey is a return to the open-world
                "sandbox" 3D style of game, with "more open-ended exploration like in Super Mario 64 and
                Super Mario Sunshine. It was released in October 2017 for Nintendo Switch. After Mario's cap is
                possessed by a spirit named Cappy, he gains the new move of temporarily "capturing" enemies and objects
                to utilize their abilities. Like previous sandbox 3D games, the game's worlds contain a large variety of
                objectives that can be achieved in a non-linear order before progressing. The game features many
                different kingdoms in addition to the Mushroom Kingdom that Mario's adventures usually take place in,
                and is the first in the series to include a vocal theme song, "Jump Up, Super Star!"

            <h2>Bowser's Fury</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Bowser's Fury is part of the 2021 re-release of Super Mario 3D World on the Nintendo Switch. It
                implements 3D open-world "free-roaming" gameplay in a similar fashion to Odyssey, from which it includes
                many elements. Supporting up to two players, it sees Mario teaming up with Bowser Jr. to collect
                Cat Shines to restore lighthouses in a land called Lake Lapcat. Periodically, a gigantic incarnation of
                Bowser known as Fury Bowser awakens to bring darkness upon the land and attacks the island. To beat him,
                Mario must collect enough Cat Shines to awaken the Giga Bell and use it to fight Bowser.

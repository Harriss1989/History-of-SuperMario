# Stucture
The site consists of three main pages Super Mario, Character's, Newsletter and a hiddin thank you page when all user detail are entered in to form and submited.
# Design

The site design evolved over time from origanl plans, feed back from user input made me re-think the layout as there was alot of information on one page. After thinking from a users perspective I decided to redisign the site just focusing on Super Mario and the main 5 character's. The site consists of a main informtion page with a breif history of super Mario, a list of the main titles from the franchise on which consloe it was relised for. The second page consists of a character bio, giveing a decrition of the main 5 characters and there abilitys thorought the series. the 3rd page is a sign up to newsletter as this is not a live site the sign up page once etails are added brings the user to a hidden thank you page.

## Balsamiq:
Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process. The wirefames do not match the final deployed site, after user feedback on early development of the site i decided to to change the lay out, to make it more user friendly. I removed the hisory of Nintendo and changed it to a charater bio page for the main 5 charaters. I belive this make for a more streamline version of the site keeping content to a minimum.
